# Structure of the Wiki

The source code for the wiki is located at https://github.com/igembitsgoa/wiki. The repo contains two folders, `src` and `dist`, which stand for source and distribution, respectively.

The `src` folder contains editable files, while the `dist` folder contains the final compiled code that will go up on iGEM servers. 

The `src` folder contains two folders where the content resides: `pages` and `assets`. 

Let's look at `pages` first. This folder contains a list of all the pages that will be served on the wiki. 
```
pages
    Description.pug
    Design.pug
    Human_Practices.pug
    ...
```
The `assets` folder contains images which will be described in greater detail in [the Images section](7-images.md).
